     At yesterday’s Eclipse MicroProfile public hangout, we had two major announcements: First, that we have
     announced the content for the next major MicroProfile 1.1 release and, second, that we have a new MicroProfile logo.

      On June 13, 2017, SmartBear joined the Eclipse
      MicroProfile project, an open source community specification for Enterprise Java microservices. As someone
      interested in microservices, why is this news important?

      As I write this blog post, on Tuesday 27th June 2017, I’m looking through memories of where I was on this day
      in 2016: participating in the keynote speech at Red Hat’s DevNation conference in San Francisco.

      Java EE developers are now experimenting with microservices and they need a coherent way to
      optimize their development efforts. Over the years, Java EE has supported distributed application architectures
      based on RMI/IIOP, Web Services and REST. The Eclipse MicroProfile project is the next step in that evolution
      because it optimizes enterprise Java for a microservices architecture.

      Hear from John Clingan, Sr. Principal Product Manager, Red Hat, and Ken Finnigan,
      Red Hat in this breakout session at Red Hat Summit 2017. MicroProfile is a community-led effort to bring
      microservices to Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) across multiple implementations, including WildFly
      Swarm, IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile, Apache TomEE, Payara Micro, and Hammock.

      Organizations that have already embarked or are thinking about starting a digital transformation journey are
      assessing and looking for ways to leverage their Java EE expertise. IT development and operations have built
      Java expertise over years, and there is a challenge to balance their existing skill base with new digitally
      transformative technologies, such as microservices, APIs, container-based architectures, and reactive programming.
      Eclipse MicroProfile is an open source project and one of those digitally transformative technologies that
      enables and optimizes the development of microservices — using familiar Java EE technologies and APIs.

      I want to take a quick break from the other series for a moment to do something I've been remiss about for a
      while: addressing a recent report by Gartner on the state of Java EE. Before doing so I decided the other day to
      read the article my friend and colleague John Clingan made a few weeks ago and I realised that John had done a
      great job already.

      I was recently pointed to Gartner’s Market Guide to Application Platforms report, written by Anne Thomas and
      Aasish Gupta. The report takes a very negative view of Java EE to the point that I thought I was reading an
      obituary. To summarize their report, “Run, Run Away” from Java EE. Hey, if I ever grew up, it was in the 80s.

      2016 has been a bit of a wild ride, to say the least. Lots of major things have happened politically and in
      popular culture. Considering the world of Java and its related ecosystems, we've seen a lot of activity too,
      with announcements about the delay of Java 9, the concerns raised by the Java EE Guardians (shared by many),
      and a largely unprecedented move in the establishment of the MicroProfile initiative.

      Back in June we announced MicroProfile with RedHat, IBM, Tomitribe, LJC and SouJava and Microprofile.io was
      launched as a location for community collaboration on Enterprise Java Microservices. In the announcement each of
      the vendors promised to have a MicroProfile runtime ready and available in time for JavaOne. Well  after much
      beavering away here in the Payara Engineering team we have just pushed onto Maven Central our 1.0 release of
      Payara MicroProfile.

      Eclipse MicroProfile 1.1, which builds on the 1.0 version, adds a brand new Config API. Eclipse MicroProfile
      Config addresses this challenge by defining the framework and APIs to easily set and manage environment
